@CyrusofChaos
who sent that letter with no return address
who once used a spork as a knife
who once killed two stones with one bird
who is from the same planet as Elijah Granet
who likes to add madness to any method
who plays with two full decks of cards
who can flunge backwards
who once had a coconut apologize for almost falling on him
who usually gets paid a quarter for his thoughts
whose words speak as loudly as his actions
whose tail would always be wagging if he was a dog

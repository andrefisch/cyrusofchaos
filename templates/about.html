<p class="p4"><span class="s1">In the annals of human history, a few great inventions have revolutionised fencing. The first of these, the mask, sharply reduced the rate of decapitations in matches. The second of these, electricity, allowed for fencing matches to be held at night. The third and most important of these, this website, allows you to understand what's happening in the NCAA Fencing Championships without actually having to do any math. Truly, we live in an age of wonder.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">You're welcome.</span></p>

<h2><span class="s1"><b>Competition Format:</b></span></h2>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The format of the NCAA Fencing Championships is as follows: for each combination of weapon and gender ({{order[0].lower()}}'s and {{order[1].lower()}}'s sabre, epee, and foil), there are 24 competitors. Some schools have entered as many as 12 competitors across the various events, while others have just one. No event can have more than two competitors from any one school.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">Every competitor fences 23 five-touch bouts over the course of their two day event (i.e. each competitor fences every other competitor). The three {{order[0].lower()}}'s events are fenced on Thursday March 21nd, and Friday March 22rd, while the {{order[1].lower()}}'s events are fenced on Saturday March 23th and Sunday March 24th. A more detailed schedule is given below.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The six individual championships are determined by a four person bracket made up of the top four individual finishers in each event. Fifteen-touch bouts then determine the winner of the individual championship.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The team championship is determined by aggregating the number of wins in the regular competition (i.e. the fifteen-touch individual championship bouts do not affect the outcome of the team championships). The team with the most wins is crowned team champion.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<h2><span class="s1"><b>Website Format:</b></span></h2>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">This website helps followers of the NCAA Fencing Championships observe how close a team is to winning this championship. The following information is available for all schools: the school's place in the competition, the number of fencers each team has qualified to compete, the amount of bouts won so far, the win percentage, how many bouts remain, and (except for the first place school) how many bouts behind the leader each school is.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">The school in the top row is the school in first place. For this school, the number of bouts a school needs to "clinch" the championship is displayed (with the win percentage needed to "clinch" in parentheses). A school has "clinched" (i.e. won the NCAA Championships), when no school, even with a 100% win percentage, could surpass said school's total bouts. When the first place school has clinched, a special message will indicate this.</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s1">For all other schools, the number of bouts they need to win to catch the leading school is displayed with the win percentage needed to take the lead in parentheses.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p4"><span class="s1">In the annals of human history, a few great inventions have revolutionised fencing. The first of these, the mask, sharply reduced the rate of decapitations in matches. The second of these, electricity, allowed for fencing matches to be held at night. The third and most important of these, this website, allows you to understand what's happening in the NCAA Fencing Championships without actually having to do any math. Truly, we live in an age of wonder.</span></p>
